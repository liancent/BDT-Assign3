# BDT-Assign3

Create a Python Application, that 

    Reads JSON from API
    Inserts into RedisJSON
    Does some processing (3 outputs) such as (matplotlib charts, aggregation,search,..)
    

The Python Application should be

- Using Python Classes (not plain scripting as shown in lecture notes)
- Should contain necessary DocString
- Should be aligned properly
- Code should be Pushed to GitHUB Public Repo. (Not uploaded)

Submit the following

- Github URL.
- Capture Input/output as screenshots (should be clearly visible) and add it to Google DOC and share the URL.

Follow the URL guidelines(clickable, Shared and No Email Notification)

Just a friendly heads-up: 
for EACH little slip-up, like Python Classes, missing docstrings, uploading manually to Github or messy code alignment, url guidelines you'll lose 5 points
